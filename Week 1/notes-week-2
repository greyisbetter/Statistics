# Introduction
**What is statistical inference?**
- What percentage of voters approve of the way the U.S. President is handling his job?
- This is difficult to determine exactly as there are more than 250 million people of voting age in the U.S.
- But it's not difficult to *estimate* this percentage quite well:
- Sample 1,000 (say) voters at random. Then use the approval percentage among those voters as an estimate for the approval percentage of all voters.

**Population**: the entire group of subjects about which we want information. Ex: all U.S. voters
**Parameter**: the quantity about the population we are interested in . Ex: approval percentage among all U.S. voters
**sample** is the part of the population from which we collect information. That would be the 1,000 voters which were selected at random.
