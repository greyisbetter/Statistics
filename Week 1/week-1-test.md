## Introduction and Descriptive Statistics for Exploring Data

1. 
dot plot and pie chart because Box plots are useful when you want to visualize numerical data and see how spread your data is.

2. 
Men = 7.9 + 5.8 + 3.3
Women = 6.3 + 4.2 + 2.0

=> 14.75

3. 
Men:
15- 14.7
20- 13.9
10- 13.5
30- 13.5
5- 9.7
45- 7.9
60- 5.8
25- 5.6
40- 3.4
90- 3.3
<5- 3.2
0- 2.9
35- 2.7

=> 60-89 minutes

Women:
15- 16.1
10- 15.7
20- 14.1
30- 11.9
5- 11.8
45- 6.3
25- 5.6
60- 4.2
0- 3.7
<5- 3.3
40- 2.9
35- 2.3
90- 2.0

=> 25-29 minutes

4. Median summary measure is use to compare the two states to protect from skewed data

5. the mean household income goes up by 5% because in a number line if every number shifted to 5% right then mean is also shifted to 5% right

6. median household income goes up by 5% same as mean example

7. the standard deviation of the household incomes goes up by 5% because each number is increased by 5% so the spread also increase by same
hint: try to test in random 5 num: 2 3 4 5 6= 1 => 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6= 1.1

8. the interquartile range of the household incomes goes up by 5% same as std

9. the mean household income goes up by $5,000

10. the median household income goes up by $5,000

11. the standard deviation of the household incomes doesn't change because every number shifted to right by 5% so the spread will remain the same.

12. the interquartile range of the household incomes doesn't change same as std example

13. the houses that sold for more than $342,000 represent exactly 50% of all sales: ?
